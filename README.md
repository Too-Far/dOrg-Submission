## Client Dashboard for dOrg projects

The purpose of this project is to create a prototype for a client facing dashboard that will allow clients to track the progress of their project.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My desire with this project was to provide a simple demonstration of a dashboard that could easily be implemented as a functioning and finished application. The possibilities of this project really are endless, and I just put in what I thought would be important to clients.

## The Future of The Project

This project isn't too far from being functional and extremely useful. In order to turn this into a functioning MVP, we will need to implement some of the following.

-   Need to hook up the crypto payment portal to the dOrg contract.
-   I will need to write tests. This was foregone for the moment in the interest of time, and with the knowledge that there will likely need to be changes.
-   Will need to provide authentication for the rare case that a principal of the project does not have MetaMask.
-   Need to integrate several more wallets
-   Create API's for live data (Currently dummy data is used)
-   Anything else you guys want!
